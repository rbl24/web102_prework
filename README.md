## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some very minor challenges faced were brainstorming a cool additional feature and refreshing myself on the Git terminology and functionality.

## Future Improvements

1. What if a user discovers the site and wants to search for a specific game they have heard of?

A search bar could be added to the top of the site that allows users to type in game names. As they type, matching games from the list could be filtered or highlighted in real time using JavaScript.

2. What if a user wants to use the nav bar at the top of the page to get to the Our Game section quickly?

Add an anchor link in the navbar that scrolls smoothly to the #games-container section. For example, use <a href="#games-container">Our Games</a> and enable smooth scrolling in CSS with scroll-behavior: smooth;

3. How would you update the CSS of the site to make it more visually appealing?

- Improve the hover effects / dynamic effects
- Make the dark mode and general color palettes more united and consistent
